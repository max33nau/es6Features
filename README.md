# es6Features

Requirements and Location
1. Arrow Functions: Used throughout entire project
2. Classes Done in the extraES6features under lib, Just converted my old properties for array
3. Class with inheritance
4. Template strings: Used through entire project can be found in test folder and lib/player_handler.js
5. Default arguments
6. Promises: Used promises that were returned using chai-http and used with the mongoose api that returns promises. The catch was used in chai-http and I put my callback done in the .catch() because if you put anything else in the done() such as done(error) your test wont pass.
7. Extra features: Used the enhanced object properties in my dbData object in lib/database.js and I also used the features including the importing and exporting of modules.
8. No es5 Check: To the best of my knowledge I do not think I used any es5 features where I could have used es6 but it is possible I missed something.
